            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I will adventure to ſay (though I neither know the Author, nor have any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him) that later years have ſcarcely ſhewed a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, choice, or ſeaſonable Diſcourſe: And I doubt not but its own worth will ingage all ſerious Chriſtians to accept and value it, more then any Letters of Commendation from me can do.</p>

               <p>TO this I ſhall ſpeak, 1. More <hi>Generally,</hi> then 2. More <hi>Specially. In General,</hi> I ſhall premiſe briefly, 1. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Object,</hi> and then 2. Touching the <hi>Act</hi> or

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p>In this ſenſe, the Apoſtle ſeemeth to underſtand this
<hi>term</hi> in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Eſteeming the reproach of, or for Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt was not reproached by the Egyptians in his
<hi>perſon,</hi> to whom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46140:5"/> (as far as appears) he was not at all yet made known: But theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were rather, in what <hi>he</hi> had preſcribed, and <hi>his</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> which (as <hi>Moſes</hi> well knew) Chriſt had imparted, and in the
<hi>Duties</hi> which (as he well knew alſo) Chriſt had injoyned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſticks not to call the Goſpel of Chriſt by this name, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23,24. Chriſt being (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of the Goſpel; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all matters of Chriſtian Belief and Obedience. Plainly, <hi>The preaching of Chriſt,</hi> imports the preaching of whatſoever matters of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip</hi> are preſcribed by, and point us to him, as their <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Author, Acts</hi> 5.42.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 11.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.5. <hi>Phil</hi> 1.15-19.</p>
               <p>Hence, the confeſſion of Chriſt muſt import alſo, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of whatſoever matters he hath ſo preſcribed, whether of Faith or Worſhip. For your <hi>profeſsion</hi> of him muſt be of the ſame latitude with our <hi>preaching</hi> of him, and ſo, extenſive to the <hi>whole</hi> Doctrine contained in his Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5, <hi>ad finem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Words</hi> of Chriſt (which comprehend all the
<hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and <hi>Duties of</hi> Godlineſs) are
<hi>explicitely</hi> made the Object of confeſſion, together with Chriſt,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.26. And they that have learned <hi>theſe concerns,</hi> are <hi>therein</hi> ſaid to have learned Chriſt; as likewiſe thoſe that <hi>deny</hi> them, are <hi>therein</hi> ſaid to deny
<hi>him.</hi> There is ſo exact, and cloſe an union and connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them, which carry the impreſſion of Chriſts name upon them,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Jude</hi> v. 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p>Let me ſubjoyn; that as Chriſt accounts thoſe acts of
<hi>charity</hi> done to, or detained from <hi>him,</hi> which are done to, or detained from <hi>his Members,</hi> Matth. 25 40,45. So, he accounts thoſe acts of <hi>confeſsion</hi> as done to, or detained from <hi>himſelf,</hi> which are in declaring for, or denying of <hi>his Matters,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.2,3. 2 Joh. <hi>v.</hi> 3,9.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>act</hi> or <hi>operation</hi> before us, in reference to this <hi>Object,</hi> is to <hi>confeſs,</hi> [<hi>What is it to confeſs Chriſt?</hi>] This is (1) <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46140:6"/> of three things in the <hi>Negative; viz.</hi>
1. Of <hi>Denying</hi> him and his <hi>Truths</hi> (oppoſed to confeſſing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.32,33. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.8,9.) 2. Of
<hi>Detaining</hi> or withholding our <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> whether by a downright concealment, or by diſſembling co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. 3. And of
<hi>Deferring</hi> or delaying our <hi>Teſtimony</hi> till another time, when it is of <hi>preſent</hi> debt and uſe. Theſe two are <hi>implicitely, interpretatively,</hi> and to their <hi>degree,</hi> a deniall of Chriſt. (2)
'Tis <hi>Incluſive</hi> of this, in the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> 1. That we
<hi>acknowledge</hi> Chriſt and his concerns. 2. <hi>Actually,</hi> or in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: and alſo. 3. <hi>Openly</hi> or <hi>publickly, i. e.</hi> not onely in <hi>ſecret,</hi> between God and my own ſelf, but ſo, as it may be to others <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>obſervation</hi> alſo. So much 1. The Notation of the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and
<hi>Confitebitur</hi> doth import: 2. And the next words to <hi>confeſs</hi> do intimate it, <hi>viz. before men:</hi> 3. And that noble and worthy Promiſe of Chriſt, immediately ſubjoyned, does inſtruct us as much alſo, <hi>I alſo will confeſs,</hi> i. e. I will <hi>openly acknowledge him before the Angels, and before my Father which is in heaven,</hi> Mat.
10.32. Luke 12.8.</p>
               <p>But more <hi>eſpecially.</hi> What it is to <hi>confeſs Chriſt,</hi> ſeems beſt explicated, by conſidering 1 How 'tis
<hi>injoyned,</hi> and 2. How 'tis <hi>illuſtrated</hi> in the Scriptures laſt mentioned.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>injoyned</hi> as a <hi>Debt ef Juſtice</hi> from us to him: from <hi>us,</hi> as his <hi>Inferiors;</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> as our
<hi>Superior.</hi> So that to confeſs Chriſt, beſpeaks ſuch an open acknowledgement of him, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth 1. His <hi>Rights,</hi> both of
<hi>Dignity</hi> with him, and of <hi>Dominion</hi> over us. 2. And our
<hi>Relation</hi> to, and <hi>dependance</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>illuſtrated</hi> by Chriſts confeſſion of us, which is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the acknowledgement of our <hi>near Relations</hi> to him, and of his <hi>dear Affections</hi> for us: So that this confeſſion of Chriſt by us, implies likewiſe our publick acknowledgement of his

               </p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>We are to acknowledge the Rights and Dignities of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 2.11. This is to profeſs our Faith of Chriſt, and ſpeaks the <hi>profeſſed ſenſe we have of him.</hi> Theſe Rights being of a <hi>large compaſs,</hi> this confeſſion cannot be of a

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>Secondly, We are to acknowledge openly our <hi>Relations to,</hi> and <hi>dependance on Chriſt,</hi> Iſaiah 45.23,24. This is to confeſs our <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and ſpeaks our <hi>profeſſed Subjection</hi> to Chriſt. Our Relation to him is not founded onely upon an

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Is your Heart with it? Profeſsing</hi> of, yea or <hi>Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in Chriſts Name, is but as a <hi>cypher</hi> without a <hi>figure,</hi> and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth nothing to Salvation, till the heart comes and gives <hi>value</hi> to it: Otherwiſe our precious Saviour would never <hi>profeſs</hi> unto ſuch perſons, <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye that work iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Mat. 7.22,23. <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdome, and his tongue talketh of judgement:</hi> (May not others do the ſame? True; but) <hi>the Law of God is in his heart.</hi> There is a copy <hi>within,</hi> of what he confeſſeth <hi>without, Pſal.</hi> 37.30,31. His <hi>outward expreſsions</hi> are anſwered by, and with <hi>inward impreſsions.</hi> The Spirit hath tranſcribed thoſe
<hi>Truths</hi> upon his heart inwardly, which he utters by the inſtruments of ſpeech outwardly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi>
8.9. Sirs, 'tis not the confeſsion of Chriſt without you, but
<hi>Chriſt</hi> confeſſed <hi>within you, that is the hope of glory: Behold, he deſireth truth in the inward parts,</hi> Col. 1.27. Pſal.
51.6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>How is your heart in it?</hi> He is not a confeſſor, that is <hi>one outwardly onely,</hi> neither is that confeſsion, which is <hi>outward in the fleſh;</hi> but he is the confeſſor, that is <hi>one inwardly,</hi> and that the confeſsion to Salvation, <hi>which is of the heart and of the Spirit,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46140:14"/> whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2 28,29. &amp; 10.9,10. They are the onely <hi>Citizens</hi> of
<hi>Sion</hi> which is above, <hi>who ſpeak the truth in their heart,</hi> Pſal. 15.1,2.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How are you <hi>affected</hi> towards Chriſt then, and to his truths and goodneſs which you confeſs? <hi>You have</hi> (it may be) received the truth in the <hi>light</hi> of it; but <hi>have you received the truth in the love of it?</hi> Otherwiſe, you cannot be

<hi>goodneſs</hi> of it, as ſanctifying the <hi>will,</hi> as ſtaying and limiting the <hi>affections</hi> from ſin, and about ſenſual objects:
<hi>Thy word is very pure, therefore doth thy ſervant love it,</hi> ſaith

<hi>judgement,</hi> and in the <hi>election</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> to all creatures, to all comforts: yea, not onely ſo prefers his pleaſant
<hi>communion,</hi> but his precepts and <hi>commands. How ſweet are Chriſts words! yea, ſweeter then the honey and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-comb,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. &amp; 19.10. Can you then, in your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, affirm before him with that holy confeſſor, <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, they are the rejoycing of my heart: I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above much fine gold; and eſteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right,</hi> Pſal. 119.111,127,128. &amp; 19.10.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whence ariſeth it?</hi> Is it from ſanctifying the Lord
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46140:14"/> God in your hearts within? or from ſtrength of arguments, or ſecular attractives without? Is it from internal
<hi>principles,</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>perſwaſives?</hi> Special confeſſion hath its <hi>ſpring</hi> in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> it is a <hi>ſtream</hi> and iſſue from <hi>ſanctifying the Lord God in our hearts,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15,16. The language and life without are from the Law within. 'Tis the renewed minde transformed into the likeneſs of truth within, that runs forth by the mouth and members without. If you have indeed
<hi>learned Christ, and have been taught the truth as it is in Jeſus, you will have put on the New man, as well as profeſs new matters,</hi> Pſa.
40.8,9,10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20-25. Whence ariſeth your confeſſion then? Do you <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and therefore ſpeak?</hi> Doth the confeſſion of your Faith in Chriſt outwardly, come from the cloſing of your heart by Faith with Chriſt, as the <hi>Lord your righteouſneſs,</hi> inwardly? This is the onely confeſsion that is conſequenced with Salvation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9,10. 2 Cor 4.13.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>How is it acted or put forth?</hi> In what manner? [See <hi>Queſt</hi> 8] What motions or <hi>acts of grace</hi> are in it? Conference is an act of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as you are <hi>men;</hi> but confeſsion is (or ſhould be) an act of <hi>Religion,</hi> as you are
<hi>new men.</hi> What religious <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> then are at work herein? what
<hi>graces</hi> are put into <hi>act?</hi> what love to your Saviour? what love to Souls? what Faith in, what fear of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> 'Tis
<hi>Reaſon</hi> put into <hi>act,</hi> that diſcriminates your ſpeech from a <hi>Parrot</hi> that ſpeaks ſome words (good or bad as he is taught) as well as you: But here wants the <hi>diſcourſe of reaſon,</hi> and ſo
'tis a bruitiſh act in this Bird notwithſtanding. Brethren, ſo 'tis

<hi>formally</hi> be called a Religious confeſsion of him, while their
<hi>hearts are removed from him, and he is far from their reins: They make mention of the Name of the Lord, but not in truth or in righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. Jer. 12.2. Iſa. 48.1.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>What are your ayms by it?</hi> You ſhould
<hi>confeſs that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46140:15"/> Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of the Father,</hi> Phil 2.11. Special grace ſeeks his glory upmoſt; and therefore confeſſeth both his ſin and his Saviour, that he may <hi>give glory to the Lord his God, Joſh.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. What ſeek you then? what is it your ſouls firſt intend by it, and do moſt fervently deſire ſhould be the iſſue of it? Is it <hi>your</hi> glory, or the glory of <hi>God</hi> and growth of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that you
<hi>principally</hi> deſign by it? Oh! how can you believe, and therefore how confeſs ſavingly and obedientially, <hi>who receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only?</hi> and while you
<hi>love the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God?</hi> Joh. 5.44. &amp; 12.42,43 The moſt ſplendid confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by the mouth (with the moſt delicious flouriſhes of <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> or moſt demonſtrative furniture of <hi>Logick</hi>) yea the moſt cheerful ſufferings of Martyrdom which ariſe not from Charity (that diſpoſeth the Soul to intend God chiefly) profit nothing to ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2,3. But if this be your <hi>ultimate end,</hi> that by <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> he may be glorified by you, and his Chriſt may be magnified in you: If your main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be not applauſe with men, but to approve your ſelves to him, and to advance his concernments; if it be in

               <p>VVHether we may or ſhould confeſs Chriſt before God his Father, and before the holy Angels, as he alſo will confeſs us, is not the intent of this <hi>Queſtion;</hi> but before what <hi>men</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46140:15"/> we ſhould confeſs Chriſt. Here know, that (1) Men are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſideration, according to their different capacities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Some men are only in a <hi>private</hi> capacity, others are in a <hi>publick</hi> capacity and authority. (2) And as this Authority is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either 1. Civil; or 2. Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical: So alſo this publick capacity of men may be differenced into that which is 1.
<hi>Civil;</hi> and 2. that which is <hi>Spiritual</hi> and
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> In that capacity (in their circuits &amp; limits of government) are <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> both <hi>Supreme and Subordinate:</hi> In this capacity are <hi>Miniſters</hi> (in their reſpective limits of government) in the <hi>Churches</hi> of Jeſus. (3) The conditions of men are alſo different; <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Some are <hi>within</hi> Chriſt,
<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Others are <hi>without</hi> Chriſt. (4) And of theſe 1. Some
<hi>manifeſt hopes,</hi> that they will do us or it <hi>no harm,</hi> and (perhaps) that we may do them <hi>ſome good.</hi> 2. Others <hi>manifeſt hardneſs,</hi> and ſuch as prevents our hopes of doing good hereby to their perſons, and perſwades our hearts of their deſigning evil (by occaſion of this) to our perſons, and likewiſe (it may be) to our profeſſion.</p>

Now ordinarily is the moſt ſoul enriching intercourſe with God, and the moſt ſoul-raviſhing illapſes from God; even to <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> [1 Pet. 1.6,7,8.] Now it was that <hi>Stephen ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> And that he ſaid to others, <hi>Behold, I ſee the heavens opened,</hi> &amp;c. Now when the ſhowers of ſtones (like a ſtorm of haile) fell upon this holy Confeſſour, who was yet, <hi>full of the holy Ghoſt, and of power,</hi> Act. 7.55,56.</p>

43.10. Sirs, you are neereſt related to him, of all the world; May I not ſay to you, in the words of <hi>Pilate, Behold your King;</hi> Treaſon of the deepeſt dye, to ſay with thoſe wicked Jews! <hi>Away with him, away with him, and crucifie him,</hi> rather then adventure to confeſſe him
[<hi>Iohn</hi> 19.14,15] Behold your <hi>maſter,</hi> your <hi>friend,</hi> that <hi>calls you not henceforth ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> comparatively, not ſo much ſervants as friends) <hi>for the ſervant knoweth not what, his Lord doth; But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have called you friends,</hi> [John 15.15.] What! and yet loath to confeſſe

2.11,12.] And are you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to call him brother, that yet lie upon the dung-hill. In ſhort, Behold your beloved <hi>husband, you are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones: This is a great myſtery.</hi> How ſhould your thoughts be taken up in expatiating touching his honour, and your happineſſe!

How ſhould you tell every one that asketh you, in the language of the ſpouſe [<hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9 <hi>ad finem</hi>] <hi>He is the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, he is altogether lovely — This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <p n="1">I. Firſt, The ſpirit of glory reſts upon you, while you are vilified for your teſtimony. <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are you, for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you; On their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glorified</hi> [1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14] You may bind ſuch contumelies to you, as a crown of glory, and as a Diadem of beauty.

                  <p n="2">II. Secondly, The ſequel will be victory to your teſtimony, if not a vindication of your ſelves too: Oh the ſucceſſion of conqueſts which have been made, down along all ages, by the ſealed confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſacred martyrs! What acclamations are there!
<hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! victory! Now is come ſalvation, and ſtrength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt: For the accuſer of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is caſt down,</hi> &amp;c. How <hi>overcame</hi> they? <hi>By the blood of the

                  <p>Farther it may be attended with your <hi>vindication</hi> alſo <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia kept his word, and denied not the name of Chriſt.

                  <p n="3">III. Thirdly, You are ſecured in your lives, till you have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your teſtimony: You are <hi>immortal,</hi> till your witneſſe is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and your work is <hi>done:</hi> And who can deſire to live longer, that liveth in and for God here, and hopeth to live with God in glory hereafter, when he hath finiſhed his work, he had to do in grace. 'Tis ſaid, when <hi>the two witneſſes had finiſhed their teſtimony, then</hi> (and not till then) <hi>the beaſt that aſcended out of the bottomleſſe pit overcame, and killed them,</hi> Rev. 12.7. They never <hi>fell</hi> till their teſtimony was <hi>finiſhed.</hi> O ye believers, the year, month, week, day, hour of your end or death, and of effecting their deſign is under a divine limit: When our Saviour taught in the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the very teeth of his adverſaries, ſo that they might have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taken him (in the eye of ſecond cauſes) and by wicked hands have ſlain him; yet as full of enraged malice as they were; <hi>no man
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46140:23"/> laid hold on him.</hi> Why? what was the reaſon? 'Tis immediately ſubjoyned: <hi>For his hour was not yet come,</hi> John 8.20. But when that <hi>hour</hi> once came, they forthwith laid hands upon him, and led him away to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and ſo to crucifying,
<hi>Luke</hi> 22.53,54.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fear not them then, which can kill the body,</hi> ſo as to flee, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thy duty: For, beſides that, <hi>they have no more that they can do</hi> [Luke 12.4] they are under an almighty reſtraint in this alſo. The daies and accidents of your lives, yea, <hi>the very hairs of your heads are all numbred;</hi> Not only the eſſential, or integral parts of his confeſſours, but the very <hi>excrementitious</hi> are under the lock and key, the care and cuſtody of their Lord Chriſt [<hi>Job</hi> 14.5.
<hi>Luke</hi> 12.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30.] And when you have finiſhed your courſe, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up your confeſſion: let the enemy <hi>kill</hi> you, he cannot <hi>hurt</hi> you. He ſhall but let your ſoul out of
<hi>priſon,</hi> which is therewith, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately let into his
<hi>preſence,</hi> who forthwith crowns his faithful confeſſours, with a
<hi>crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7,8. Phil. 1.20,21,23.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, You are ſecured in your libertie too, ſo far, as it will further your teſtimony. And can you reaſonably expect, or religiouſly endeavour more? So long as liberty will beſt ſerve the
<hi>ends,</hi> for which you were made, are maintained, or new-made, you ſhall be ſure to have it, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſo long as it will be moſt uſeful for you to ſerve God by it. He enſured <hi>Paul</hi> as much
[<hi>Acts</hi> 18.9,10. 23.10,11. 26.16,17] And you may by faith warrant your intereſt in the <hi>ſame promiſes,</hi> as far as concerns the ſame profeſſion, and your continued preſervation will beſt promote the ſame ends. The <hi>particular</hi> ſecurity, or promiſe to
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> is applied as of <hi>general</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to all that profeſſe and imbrace Jeſus. [<hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5] Nay, the more eminently, you keep up the <hi>life of profeſſion,</hi> the more indearedly, will he keep the <hi>liberty of your perſons,</hi> as it may and will beſt ſubſerve the ſame, in a looſe and perverſe generation. You have his promiſe, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of tentation, which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them, that dwell upon the earth,</hi> [Rev.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46140:24"/> ſincere profeſſion, though they may ſharplie perſecute it. [<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18] Nor, Satan himſelf, nor any his ſubtileſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt agents and inſtruments can touch, either your <hi>ſelves</hi> or <hi>ſtates,</hi> till God <hi>ſuffereth</hi> it, whoſe glory you are pleading for, and whoſe Goſpel you profeſſe. They cannot move one <hi>link</hi> further, then he lets them out the chain, in whoſe hands it is, [<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1,2. <hi>Job</hi> c. 1, and 2]</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, your <hi>profeſſion</hi> may coſt ſome of you a <hi>priſon:</hi> But your denial of him will coſt you

2.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12,13,14.] Sirs, If you are in good earneſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you have enough not only to quicken; but to content and quiet you when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and diſcompoſed; to give courage and cheerfulneſſe, when drooping and deſpondent. Shake off all diſcouragements then; <hi>Stand faſt in the faith, quit you like men, be ſtrong: The Lord is with you, while you be with him. And if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you, But if ye forſake him, he will forſake you,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 85.2.</p>

                        <p>We may not then indulge our ſelves a <hi>liberty of equivocating,</hi> or <hi>compliance</hi> in <hi>expreſſion,</hi> to the adverſaries dialect or expectation. For 1.

                           <p>Before I conclude what concerns this Queſtion, give me leave to offer theſe four things to your Conſideration. 1. Though it ſhould be allowed you, that the <hi>external modes</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> parts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, are left free and undetermined of God (which yet cannot be ſaid of <hi>all,</hi> nor muſt be acknowledged as to
<hi>any,</hi> in an <hi>univerſal</hi> latitude, God having limited us ſo far (at leaſt) that it be not <hi>vain, ignorant, profane, irreverent,</hi> Exod, 20.7.) <hi>Yet all</hi> the <hi>external means</hi> of worſhip are plainly enough limited, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the revealed will of God, who is the onely <hi>object</hi> and <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> of divine worſhip; So that neither <hi>you,</hi> nor <hi>any</hi> may <hi>take from,</hi> or <hi>add unto</hi> them, nor <hi>turn aſide either to the right or left hand from them,</hi> Deut 4.2. &amp; 5.32,33 &amp; 12.32.

As the Civil Magiſtrates then may not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>great</hi> ſin) <hi>abuſe</hi> their Authority committed to them of God, for corrupting his Worſhip, or commanding their Subjects to wait upon it, ſo (intrinſecally) corrupted; as being that which neither conſiſts with their <hi>intruſtments</hi> as Miniſters of God, or with their <hi>engagements,</hi> or the <hi>ends</hi> of Magiſtracy, for Gods glory and the peoples good, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.25,26.30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.21,22. So the Civil Magiſtrates authority puts no obligation upon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey theſe <hi>ſinful commands,</hi> or obſerve theſe <hi>ſinful corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions</hi> of, or in the Worſhip of God. In that (1) <hi>This act</hi> of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance hereupon is <hi>ſinful</hi> (as hath been proved) and <hi>no Law</hi> doth, or can induce an obligation to that which is <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>unlawful:</hi> Nor can it indeed be called a <hi>Law</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, unleſs <hi>equivocally</hi> and in

Gods command bindes us <hi>from</hi> this attendance, and therefore mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand cannot binde us to it: Gods command doth induce the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſupreme</hi> obligation; and cannot therefore be <hi>ſuperſeded</hi> by the command of man; which (at moſt) infers but a <hi>ſecondary</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> obligation.

Hence, as the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates</hi> contract guilt to themſelves, by <hi>commanding</hi> an evil worſhip, ſo <hi>their commands</hi> thereof are too narrow a Covering for mens evil in <hi>cloſing with,</hi> or <hi>conforming</hi> to it. It will be no Apologie at Gods Barre; our Magiſtrates bid us to attend it; when we hereby break the <hi>Law of God, who is higher than the higheſt;</hi> to bend our ſelves to the <hi>luſts of man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils,</hi> and do provoke Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to pleaſe a worm on earth.</p>

5.11,12. 2 Kings 17.21,22,23. Let them inſtance not onely the <hi>Samplar of the lives,</hi> but the <hi>Statute Lawes</hi> of their Governors upon this Caſe, in the ſixth chapter of <hi>Micah:</hi> Yet God is ſo far from accepting this Plea, that he aggravateth their provocation by it; In that
<hi>the Statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the houſe of Ahab, and ye walk in their counſels, that I ſhould make thee a deſolation, &amp;c.</hi> Verſe 15, 16.

                           <p>Again, as humane Laws will not warrant our

[Exod. 33 10.] <hi>in the houſe of Rimmon; when I bowed down or worſhipped in the houſe of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy ſervant in this thing.</hi> If we <hi>thus</hi> render the words, they afford not the <hi>leaſt</hi> pretence <hi>for</hi> this practice; but an <hi>argument</hi> (rather) is prompted <hi>againſt</hi> it: <hi>Naaman</hi> imploring par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his

                        <p>(1) Get and keep up a <hi>ſpirit of faith.</hi> Oh the preciouſneſs and power of faith! which the faithful Profeſſor doth better feel then ſpeak of. Brethren, <hi>be ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and did, (<hi>Rom</hi> 4.20.) It was through the power of faith, that pious <hi>Timothy</hi> and thoſe precious
<hi>Confeſſours,</hi> Hebr. 11. <hi>profeſſed ſo good a Profeſſion</hi> before men, and of God, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>throughout</hi>) Faith will engage God with you, and you for God, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1,2. 62.1.2, &amp;c.) As ever you would fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your courſe then, and fulfil your capacity, calling, and Chriſtian Confeſſion. <hi>Keep the faith,</hi> (2 Tim. 4.7,) Faith will hold forth the Confeſſion: He that beleeves in Chriſt with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46140:60"/> the heart, will be breathing out his knowledge of Chriſt by the mouth. I <hi>beleeved therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, We alſo beleeve, and therefore ſpeak,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> Let faith but command your thoughts, and it will ſoon carry your tongues after it, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10.) Faith will hold faſt the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo <hi>even where Satan dwells,</hi> and when the Saints are ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed and ſlain, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13.) The grace of faith will not let go the doctrine of faith, whatever comes of it, but continues the ſoul grounded, ſetled and immoved, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Col.</hi>
1.23.) Let the world oppoſe, faith will overcome, and be at length too hard for all adverſaries. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world; even our faith.</hi> (1 Iohn 5.4,5.) Once more, Faith will uphold the Confeſſors. 'Tis <hi>by faith they ſtand</hi> and are eſtabliſhed: They are <hi>kept through faith,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.20. Col. 2.7. 1 Pet. 1.5.) Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>keep the faith and it will keep you, if this ſtand you ſtand,</hi> and are ſafe; if this fail you fall, and without faith you muſt needs faint and ſwoon away. Look to your faith then; be ſound in the doctrine of faith: be ſincere in the grace of faith. Here is that muſt quench temptations, and keep you up under tribulations. If you have not a ſound faith, you will ſurely turn Apoſtates, as <hi>Demas</hi> and others did.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1) Keep up the <hi>acts</hi> of faith. A <hi>lazie habit</hi> will not preſerve you. It was by faith, as in <hi>act</hi> and
<hi>exerciſe,</hi> that they did and ſuffered ſo great things,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by his faith</hi> (Hab. 2.4.) Oh! make a life of it! If this live, thou ſhalt live alſo. But if this lie dead, and in the habit only; the <hi>labours of love,</hi> and
<hi>patience of hope</hi> will be dead alſo, and if there be Profeſſion left, 'twill be but as a noiſom carcaſs in the Noſtrils of God, if not of man alſo. Act faith then, and to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. An Active faith is of an unſpeakable advantage.

What did they do and indure? or rather what did they not do and endure? through an active and acted faith, <hi>Heb.</hi>
11.32. <hi>ad finem</hi>)</p>
                        <p>What is the <hi>evil,</hi> whereby Satan or ſinners would fright you off from confeſſing Chriſt? Faith in act can and will ſhew you
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46140:60"/> a greater evil. They can ſhew you a priſon, a ſtake, an halter, and other torments. But faith can ſhew you an

                        <p>What is the <hi>good</hi> whereby they would

An <hi>unacted</hi> faith is accounted as <hi>no</hi> faith, or at beſt, but <hi>a very little faith,</hi> by our bleſſed Lord, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.35. with <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.40.

                        <p n="2">(2) Keep up ſpecially the <hi>adherence and aſſurance</hi> of faith.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Adherence</hi> of faith. This knits the heart of the holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor with Chriſt in an indiſſoluble league. If he
<hi>liveth,</hi> it ſhall be <hi>with</hi> Chriſt. If he <hi>dieth,</hi> it ſhall be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt. Thus <hi>faith</hi> hath <hi>eſpouſed Chriſts interest</hi> to him, and his <hi>own</hi> to Chriſt. <hi>Chriſts cauſe is his cauſe,</hi> Chriſts <hi>concernments</hi> are his
<hi>concernments;</hi> and there cannot be ſuch perſons or principles, as are friends or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt, but this ſoule counts them <hi>his</hi> friends, and <hi>his</hi> enemies, according to the degree of light and knowledge which he hath. When the <hi>temporarie Profeſſor</hi> doth
<hi>kiſs and part</hi> from him, <hi>now</hi> this <hi>true</hi> Confeſſor <hi>eleaveth firmest unto, and claſpeth faſtest about him,</hi> (Act. 11.23. Ioſh. 23.8.) No exigence, no exile, no threats, no tortures, no diſtreſs, no not to death it ſelf can take off the faith of
<hi>adherence,</hi> from its teſtimony to his beloved and bleſſed Ieſus. The ſoul reſolves to <hi>live his Saint,</hi> or to <hi>die his Martyr</hi> (Heb. 11.35.—38. Dan. 3.17,18.) Thoſe troubles which now
<hi>looſen</hi> him from <hi>other comforts,</hi> do yet <hi>bind</hi> him ſtronger to his <hi>only Christ,</hi> (Act. 21.13. Phil. 1.21.)</p>
                        <p>Keep up the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of faith likewiſe. Oh! the comforts, courage and conſtancy that this will furniſh you with? Who can

<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Preſence,</hi> his <hi>ſtanding at mans bar,</hi> for
<hi>ſitting upon Gods Bench,</hi> &amp;c. Well Chriſtians, would you
<hi>hold faſt the Profeſſion of your faith without wavering: Draw near with a true heart, in full aſsurance of faith. Hold fast your confidence,</hi> and you will hold faſt your confeſſion, (<hi>Col.</hi>
2.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22,23.) Are your ſpiritual ſtates at an uncertainty? ſit not down therein: <hi>But give diligence to the full aſsurance of hope; make your calling and election ſure. For he that doth theſe things ſhall never faile,</hi> Heb. 6.11. 2 Pet. 1.10,11.</p>
